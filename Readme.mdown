#XUPorter
## Overview
XUPorter can help you to add files and frameworks to your Xcode 4 project after it is generated by Unity 3D automatically and dramatically. Lot of changes from [XCodeEditor-for-Unity](https://github.com/dcariola/XCodeEditor-for-Unity). It's quite hard to fork and pull back, so I create this repo.

## Installation
Add all files of the repo to your Unity project's Editor Folder: {$ProjectFolder}/Assets/Editor/ or you can download [this unity package](http://d.pr/f/HAzc) and import to your project

/Mods folder is the demo, you can delete or substitute all files in it as soon as you know how to use XUPorter. [A simplified MiniJSON](https://github.com/prime31/UIToolkit/blob/master/Assets/Plugins/MiniJSON.cs) is used in XUPorter, if you have already used a same JSON wrapper, maybe you would like to delete or refactor it to avoid compiler errors.

XUPorter require Unity 3.5 or higher and Xcode 4 to work properly.

## Usage
After the Unity's building phase, OnPostProcessBuild in XCodePostProcess.cs will be called and Xcode project file will be modified. See /Mods folder. All .projmods (which is in JSON) will be treated as Xcode patch setting files. XUPorter will find and read all projmods files in /Assets and modify Xcode project file as settings.

* group：The group name in Xcode to which files and folders will added by this projmods file
* libs：The name of libs should be added in Xcode Build Phases, libz.dylib for example. If you want to import a .a lib to Xcode, add it as a file(in "files")
* frameworks：The name of framework should be added in Xcode Build Phases, Security.framework for example.
* headerpaths：Header Search Paths in Build Setting of Xcode
* files：Files which should be added
* folders：Folders which should be added. All file and folders(recursively) will be added
* excludes：Regular expression pattern. Matched files will not be added.
* linker_flags: Linker flags which should be added, e.g. -ObjC
